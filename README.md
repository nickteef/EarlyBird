# SmartAlarm


> *EarlyBird* is an Android application that does not only wake You up, but also makes You get up to disable the alarm by scanning the QR Code, solving an equation or taking a walk.


## General info
No more oversleeping with *EarlyBird*! Download the default QR code and print it, or scan Your own, put it in a place remote from Your bed, turn on the alarm and prepare for a more productive morning! EarlyBird will make You not only wake up, but also get up to actually turn off the alarm (unless You make the alarm snooze xD ).
